### git
Git is a source-code management tool which allows multiple developers
to work on a single software project (in git-speak, a "repo") at the same time.

### node/npm
NodeJs is a JavaScript runtime designed to run on a server; it has a rich set of
built-in libraries ("modules") to work with processes, files, network
communications, etc., as well as more than 1.3 million modules created and
maintained by its user community. 

`npm` is the "node package manager" and 
is used to retrieve and store external modules from the Npm Module Registry to
your local computer.

### yarn
Yarn is a better package manager for NodeJS.

### mongodb
Mongodb
